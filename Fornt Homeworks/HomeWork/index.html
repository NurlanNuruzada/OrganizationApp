                and Microsoft.In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would
                be
                willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing
                tracks
                to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology.
                [114] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog
                in
                the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[115] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple
                published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available
                without their FairPlay DRM.[116]
